Today seemed like a special day to write my blog post for many reasons. First, it marks the day that I was supposed to arrive in Israel according to... well... *a* plan. Second, today was my first ICC class, or Israel Core Course, of the semester. Finally, it was the first day of *madrichim*-planned (counselor-planned) programming. However, I'd like to start with a disclaimer regarding the website you are currently reading from. I, a high-school student with absolutely no prior web-design experience, coded this blog from scratch to track my experiences in Israel. Because of this, it probably will not always work perfectly, may not have the best layout or design, and might not have all the features you can normally expect from a professional blog. For example, there currently is no comment section for blog posts. I will hopefully be able to keep working on the site and improving it, so don't be alarmed if it suddenly looks a bit different than you're used to. However, despite all of the blog's shortcomings, it can still do its most important job, keep you informed on my adventures in the Promised Land.

With that said, I guess I should catch you up to speed on the story behind when I'm actually leaving for Israel. Originally, I was supposed to leave on January 24th in order to land on the 25th. However, this was then delayed two weeks to a departure date of February 7th because of a national airport shutdown in Israel. Thankfully, we learned this on January 10th, two weeks before the original start date, meaning I would not have to start my 14 day quarantine until the 24th. This also meant that I was able to keep going to my normal school, George Mason High School, for a couple extra weeks instead of withdrawing after the first semester to switch to TRY classes.

Starting on the 24th, I began quarantining in preparation for the start date of February 7th. This didn't affect my classes because I've been doing virtual learning this entire year. Around that time, we also learned that TRY would begin offering virtual classes during the week of January 31st, the week leading up to our planned departure, and continue offering them until we actually leave for Israel. With this in mind, I stayed enrolled in George Mason until the end of that week with the plan to unenroll over the weekend and switch to TRY classes. Unfortunately, this did not go exactly as planned, as the paperwork didn't actually finish being processed until Thursday. Being the good student I am, I went to both TRY classes *and* George Mason classes for a week. This was stressful.

Anyway, backing up to the 31st, we soon learned that the airport shutdown would be extended until February 7th, the same day I was supposed to leave, with the strong possibility of extending it even longer. At this point, the program realized it wouldn't be helpful to keep throwing out departure dates and seeing what sticks, so they didn't even *try* (get it?). This marked, in my opinion, the start of the worst period of this ordeal, when we didn't have even the slightest clue when we would actually be leaving. A couple days ago, the Israeli cabinet voted again on when to end the airport shutdown, and decided on February 21st. Today, TRY finally came out with a new start date, March 2nd, hopefulling ending this nightmare of uncertainty. <br><br><br>![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uj7ybEMUKmEB1bx0PazVY_IUqKHLBwDb9EOPoy2FZwSuCJMtE9kVmg5g6MjlCqgRAWvFCE4UbcIkOZdaZGajVE1imWU1gWZFHWAKn6TbKFQnQw6_j6dd_kFFkBFvMBS6RFonWJtuUw=w2400)

That should bring you more or less up to date on that front. Now, onto the more interesting, if less nerve-wracking, topics of TRY programming that has been going on. The picture above shows my school schedule that went into effect this week, with all times writen in Israel time. Because I live in the EST time zone, subtract 7 hours from the time shown to figure out the time I am actually taking the class. All of my classes and other activities run through TRY are happening through Zoom calls. Looking closely at my schedule will show a couple things that make it stand out from a normal American high school schedule. First, I have classes Sunday through Thursday instead of Monday through Friday. This is because in Israel, we do not have classes during Shabbat on Saturday and the time difference would make any it impossible to schedule a class before Shabbat starts Friday night. Second, I have classes from 10:15 in the morning to 5:00 at night, with many free periods in between. Unlike an American high school schedule with classes during the day and free time in the late afternoon, this schedule has lots of free time interspersed throughout the day. Finally, I am enrolled in two different Hebrew classes, both happening at the same time. There isn't a special reason for this, it was just a mistake that is currently in the process of being fixed. We only start Hebrew on Wednesday this week, but in later weeks, it will also be Mondays.

Another thing you might notice is that I had ICC for the first time today. The Israel Core Course is a huge part of the program I am on, Tichon Ramah Yerushalayim, or TRY. It is in this class that we will learn and explore Israel's past, from biblical times to the present. As you might know, my brother went on this program two years earlier and has been raving about his ICC teacher since. I was very happy to learn that I have the same teacher he did, Miriam Tekuzener. Today, Miriam explained to us that Hebrew does not actually have its own word for "history." היסטוריה (pronounced "hee-stor-ia") is the direct translation of the word into modern Hebrew, but this does not exist in biblical Hebrew. Instead, you would use the word for "memory" to describe past events, signifying that the past of the Jewish people is not just something to learn about, but is a part of a Jew's identity. Just as you might have been told a family story so many times that you can almost remember it happening as if you were there, Israel's past is the same way.

Moving on from academics, we also got a couple other chances to get to know the other participants of the program and our *madrichim*, or counselors. During the day, there were two "Moadon Madrichim" meetings, optional opportunities to hang out with a madrich and other students if you had a free period during that time. I was able to make one of them, run by Adi Hoyzman. During this 45 minute period, Adi had a wheel with a bunch of different questions that she spun. When the wheel landed on a question, she chose a student to answer it for the group, so we could all get to know each other better. Unfortunately, going to the other Moadom Madrichim would have cost me my lunch period, so I opted out of it.

After classes were over, we had another activity with the madrichim, this one mandatory, called "Ma'agalim" (circles). Everyone was assigned to one of the 5 madrichim, who ran activities for their group. For exmaple, I am in Edden Silverstein's Ma'agal along with 10-15 other people. The main activity we played was a "scavenger hunt" throughout our house. Edden told us a category such as "thing you would bring to a deserted island" or "thing you can't live without" and we would have 30 seconds to run and find an object that fits the category. After going around the Ma'agal, everyone saying what item they had, the group would then have a minute to choose three of the objects that best fit the category. For example, for the category "thing you need to survive quarantine in Israel," we chose a phone, a pillow, and an Echo Dot.

Even if I'm not yet in Israel, I am still having a great time going to classes and other activities. I still can't wait until March 2nd, when we leave for Israel, but TRY is definitely making the best out of the situation!
