I am currently sitting in a new bed in a new room with new people, with the idea that I'm actually in Israel just starting to sink in. However, before I talk about where I am now, I'm going to catch you up on the events leading up to it. I actually remembered to take pictures of random things, so for the most part, I will be showing those and giving a brief explaination.

It's also worth noting that the process of getting a visa, affidavit, etc. from the Israeli government in order to enter the country was a long and arduous process that I don't really feel like reliving. Anyway, on to the fun stuff!<br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[0].photo }})

The flight that I was on was organized by TRY, and most people on the program who don't live in Canada or on the West Coast were there. With all the delays and flight changes we had to go through, it was really helpful to not have to worry about moving our tickets over and over.<br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[2].photo }})

Weirdly enough, the TRY students were spread out throughout the plane, even though we were supposed to all sit together. However, it was actually really fun to sit next to two strangers! One of them was an American lone soldier going back to Israel to serve in the IDF, and the other was an Israeli going back home. Both of them were super nice and interesting!<br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[4].photo }})

We were also served dinner earlier in the flight, but I forgot to take a picture of it. It consisted of potatoes, (kosher) chicken, (very bland) couscous, a dinner roll, and a black and white cookie that was actually pretty good. All in all, it could have been much worse.<br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[7].photo }})

Avi Lurie was my brother's counselor on TRY two years ago, and by total coincidence was on the same flight as our group when he was going back home to Israel after visiting his family in America for Passover. We met him when visiting Jonah over spring break two years ago, and it was really fun to see him again!<br>

I wasn't able to find any good pictures of the entire group after the flight, so I guess you'll just have to trust me that we all actually survived. After getting through customs and our COVID tests, we got on the bus to drive to the Chava, the campus we'll be living on in Jerusalem.

I'm going to end this post here and make another one soon (hopefully) about our time in *bidud* (quarentine). However, I will say that I am having a great tiime in Israel, even if we can't really do anything.<br><br>

One other note, under the "external links" dropdown on my site, I have added a button that goes to [Jacob Sanchez's vlog](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7XCsvQ6JhQUi5QHazw0EnA), another student on TRY and my roommate. I highly encourage you to check out his videos as well!
