The picture above (left-right: Alexa Sussan, Lea Thomas) basically sums up our experiences in *Bidud*, a bunch of children happily locked up behind bars. There was a running joke in our room that we were being held in a Norwegian prison. There were great accomodations, we were allowed to spend some time outside and with the other prisoners, and the guards (also known as *madrichim*, or counselors) were super nice. However, we still weren't allowed to leave.

During Bidud, each room was put with one other to make a *capsula* or pod, that consisted of the only people you could be around other than from a distance and masked. My room, myself, Eli Lebeau, and Jacob Sanchez, was paired with CJ Wolf, Liron Elraviv, Kol Goldman, and Devin Rapaport. We all got really close (figurtively and literally), but unfortunately, Devin had to leave the program because of some personal things before Bidud even ended. We spent most of our time just in our rooms, but we could be with our pod whenever we were allowed outside or during the couple communal meals we had with them.

Time passed in a blur. It was an odd experience to have waited so long to be with these people and then see them just out of reach. We still had classes online, but at least now my roommates could join on the same computer if we were in class together. The food not only *was* delicious, but *looked* delicious (this is sarcasm). Thankfully, we were given the option to order food to the chava for dinners sometimes, which was much better.<br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[0].photo }})

After what felt like simultaneously forever and only two days, it was time to finally venture back out into the world to get our  COVID tests. 10 days had passed since we started Bidud, meaning that we would be able to end Bidud as soon as all the negative tests got back instead of waiting for two full weeks. I still remember how excited we all were to finally leave the Chava, even if it was only for 20 minutes to get a long Q-tip stuck up our nose.

After the excitement of the century, we went back to the Chava to wait for the test results back. Unfortunately, it took an extra couple days before we were freed because of a glitch in the system that temporarily lost some of the test. Thankfully, they eventually all came back and we were able to finally leave Bidud!
