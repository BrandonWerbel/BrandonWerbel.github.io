    caption: My challah turned out surprisingly well!
---

I know, I know, it's been almost two months since my last normal post. I apologize profusely, but in all honestly, not too much has really happened of note. Purim happened, Israel elections happened (again), and Passover is just ending along with Spring Break. Also, I made challah for the first time. No, I am not yet in Israel, but the airports are supposed to open tomorrow to non-Israeli citizens, which is quite exciting. However, the even more exciting news is that TRY has officially been given permission to bring us into the country on April 15th!<br><br><br>![]({{ page.pictures[0].photo }})

The other very exciting thing that happened recently was that I got my first dose of the Pfizer COVID vaccine on Monday! My mother and I had to spend seven hours in the car to get to North Carolina, but it was totally worth it. Although I won't be fully vaccinated before I'm able to get to Israel, I'll still feel a lot more comfortable on the plane with one dose than I would without it, and I will hopefully be able to get my second shot in Israel.

Hmm, this might be why it has been so long since my last post, there really just isn't that much to talk about. I will (fingers crossed) be in Israel soon, which will lead to many more interesting stories, but until then, I don't think there is anything left to report. Hopefully, it will be less than another two months before you hear from me again!
